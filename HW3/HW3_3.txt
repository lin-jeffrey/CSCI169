The output of problem 3 is explained by:
The first print of spam returns "test spam" because when do_local() is called it creates a new variable in its own scope called spam so it does not alter the spam in the scope_test() scope.
The second print of spam returns "nonlocal spam" since in the function do_nonlocal() the spam inside the function refers to the spam in the scope outside the definition scope since it has the "nonlocal" keyword.
The third print of spam also returns "nonlocal spam" since the do_global() function alters the global spam variable and does not alter the one inside the scope_test() scope. 
The fourth print of spam returns "global spam" since the print is called outside the function therefore when scope_test() is called the do_global() altered the global scope spam to be "global spam" which is then printed.
